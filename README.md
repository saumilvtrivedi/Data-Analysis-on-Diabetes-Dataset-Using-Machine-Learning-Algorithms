# Diabetes Risk Prediction Project

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately identifies individuals at risk of diabetes, utilizing a comprehensive set of medical and demographic data. 

This model aims to facilitate early diagnosis and intervention, contributing to improved health outcomes for those predisposed to diabetes.

## Process

### Dataset Overview
Analyze a dataset of 100,000 individual health records for predicting diabetes.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
Remove 3,854 duplicates and address missing or incomplete data.

### Class Imbalance Solution
Use SMOTE to balance the dataset, improving minority class prediction.

### Model Exploration
Test models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, KNN, XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM.

### Model Evaluation
Evaluate models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC.

## Project Significance

Highlight machine learning's role in healthcare for predictive diagnostics and emphasize the importance of accurate data for building reliable models.

## Result

The project resulted in a CatBoost-based predictive model that excels in identifying individuals at risk of diabetes with high accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC scores. 

This model, refined by addressing class imbalances through SMOTE, showcases the significant potential of machine learning in enhancing early diabetes detection and healthcare Diagnosis.
